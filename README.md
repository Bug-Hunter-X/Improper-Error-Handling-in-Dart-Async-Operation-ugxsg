# Dart Async Operation Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in asynchronous operations in Dart, specifically regarding insufficient error handling. The `bug.dart` file shows the flawed code, while `bugSolution.dart` presents a more robust solution.  The issue highlights the importance of specific exception handling for improved application stability and user experience.

## Bug Description

The original code lacks detailed error handling. It uses a generic `catch` block, making it difficult to diagnose and resolve specific issues.  It only prints the error to the console, providing minimal information to the user or developer.

## Solution

The improved version in `bugSolution.dart` addresses these concerns by providing more specific exception handling and informative error messages.
